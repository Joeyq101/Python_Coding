# You are required to create a application which is a simple game.  The game will function as follows:

#     Program will generate a random integer between 1 and 10
#     Program will ask the user to guess the number
#         If correct, congratulate the player, print how many guesses were made and exit
#         If incorrect, prompt the user to guess again
#     Repeat until user guesses the number

# You will need to create a algorithm (flowchart or pseudocode) as well as creating the code.
